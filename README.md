# random-exercises-cpp
Some random exercises I came up with to practice a bit of everything for revisions: exploring tricky concepts through naive or efficient approaches, digging into STL class behavior (e.g., std::optional, std::shared_ptr with single memory allocation, etc.), reviewing some fundamentals like data structures (trees, linked lists, etc.), design patterns, basic algorithms, dynamic programming, and diving deeper into Google Test / Google Mock.

## Dependencies
To compile each cpp file individually, you need the following packages :
- googletest

```sh
apt-get install googletest
```
